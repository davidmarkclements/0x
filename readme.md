## Visualize Stack Traces

`0x` can profile and generate an interactive flamegraph for a Node process in a single command, on both Linux *and* OS X. Whilst this seems trivial... it's not. Well it wasn't before `0x`.

## Demo

![](demo.gif)

An example interactive flamegraph can be viewed at <http://davidmarkclements.github.io/0x-demo/>

This demo shows a terminal preview, the default behaviour
is *not* to show a preview, you can use `-p` to turn it on.

## Support

* Node v4+

* OS
  * Linux
    * requires [perf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perf_(Linux))
  * OS X
  * SmartOS
  * *not* Windows (PR's welcome)

## Install

```sh
npm install -g 0x
```

## Basic Usage

Prefix the usual command for starting a process with 0x:

```sh
0x node my-app.js
```

All node args are supported, for instance:

```sh
0x node --trace-opt my-app.js
```

When node flags aren't required, we can use the shorthand form:

```sh
0x my-app.js
```

If we want to test against a local `node` binary, simply reference the binary directly.

For example if the `node` binary is the current working directory:

```sh
0x ./node my-app.js
```

## Generating

Once we're ready to generate a flamegraph we send a SIGINT.

The simplest way to do this is pressing CTRL+C.

When `0x` catches the SIGINT, it process the stacks and
generates a profile folder, containing flamegraph.html


## Docker
Due to security reasons Docker containers tend to result in the following error:

```bash
Cannot read kernel map
perf_event_open(..., PERF_FLAG_FD_CLOEXEC) failed with unexpected error 1 (Operation not permitted)
perf_event_open(..., 0) failed unexpectedly with error 1 (Operation not permitted)
Error:
You may not have permission to collect stats.
[...]
```
We can work around this problem by running our container with the `--privileged` option
or add `privileged: true` in your `docker-compose.yml` file.
See the [Docker's doc](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities) for more info.


## Production Servers

Generating a flamegraph can be quite intense on CPU and memory,
if we have restricted resources we should generate the flamegraph
in two pieces.

First we can use the `--stacks-only` flag to purely capture stacks.

```sh
0x --stacks-only my-app.js  #0x on the server
```

Press ctrl+c when ready, this will create the usual profile folder,
holding one file, that `stacks.$PID.out` file.

Now we need to transfer the stacks file from our production server
to our local dev machine.

Let's say the pid was 7777, we can generate the flamegraph locally with

```sh
0x -c gen stacks.7777.out # 0x locally
```

Now the hard work is done away from production, ensuring we avoid any service-level problems.

## 0x Flags

### --help | -h

Print usage info

### --preview

Generates an SVG file, prerenders SVG inside HTML
and outputs a PNG to the terminal (if possible)
Depends on imagemagick (brew install imagemagick)
If using iTerm 2.9+ image will be output to terminal
Warning - depending on the amount of stacks this
option can take tens of seconds

Default: false

### --delay | -d

Milliseconds. Delay before tracing begins (or before stacks are processed in the Linux case), allows us to ignore
initialisation stacks (e.g. module loading).

Example: `0x -d 2000 my-app.js`

Default: 300

### --langs | -l

Color code the stacks by JS and C

Example: `0x -l my-app.js`

Default: false

### --tiers | -t

A comma separated list

Overrides langs, Color code frames by type

Examples: `0x -t my-app.js`

Default: false

### --exclude | -x

Exclude tiers or langs, comma seperated list

Options: v8, regexp, nativeC, nativeJS, core, deps, app, js, c

Examples:
`0x -x v8,nativeC,core my-app.js`
`0x -x c my-app.js`

Default: v8

### --include

Include tiers, Overwrites exclude. Really only useful
for including the v8 tier (which is excluded by default).

Options: v8, regexp, nativeC, nativeJS, core, deps, app, js, c

Example: `0x --include v8 my-app.js`

Default: false

### --theme

Dark or Light theme

Options: dark | light

Example: `0x --theme light my-app.js`

Default: dark

### --stacks-only

Don't generate the flamegraph, only create the stacks
output. If assigned to '-' stacks output will come through
stdout. Use this in combination with the `-c gen` argument
to generate the flamegraph from raw stacks.

Options: false | true | -

Examples:

`0x --stacks-only my-app.js`

`0x --stacks-only=- my-app.js`

Default: false

### --trace-info

Show output from dtrace or perf tools

Default: false

### --cmd | -c

Run a "0x command", possible commands are `help` and `gen`.

#### `0x -c help`
outputs advanced usage (i.e. the commands).

#### `0x -c gen`

The gen command will generate the flamegraph from
a stacks.out file.

Example: `0x -c gen [flags] profile-$PID/stacks.$PID.out > flamegraph.html`

Flags include all the flags that can be passed to 0x

#### `--timestamp-profiles`

Adds the current timestamp to the Profile Folder's name minimizing collisions
for in containerized environments

Example: `profile-3866-`

## The Profile Folder

A profile folder will be created and named after the PID, e.g.
`profile-3866`.

The Profile Folder can contain the following files

* flamegraph-small.png - the preview image output to terminal
* flamegraph.svg - an SVG rendering of the flamegraph
* stacks.3866.out - the traced stacks (run through [perf-sym](http://npmjs.com/perf-sym) on OS X)
* flamegraph.html - the interactive flamegraph
* stacks.3866.json - a JSON tree generated from the stacks, this tree is rendered by d3.js in the flamegraph.html

The is helpful, because there's other things you can do with
stacks output. For instance, checkout [cpuprofilify](http://npmjs.com/cpuprofilify) and [traceviewify](http://npmjs.com/traceviewify).

## Example

Want to try it out? Clone this repo, run `npm i -g` and
from the repo root run

```sh
0x examples/rest-api
```

In another tab run

```sh
npm run stress-rest-example
```

To put some load on the rest server, once that's done
use ctrl + c to kill the server.

Now try some other options, e.g.

```sh
0x -t examples/rest-api
```

### Or using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
_this process has been tested on linux, different milage may apply on OSX with boot2docker_
Clone this repo and `cd` to the `examples/docker` folder

```
docker-compose up
```
open another shell and send you SIGINT:

```
sudo kill -s SIGINT `ps aux | grep 'node /usr/local/bin/0x' | head -1| awk '{print $2}'`
# might differ for boot2docker
```
docker-compose can now be stopped, the profile directory will be inside `examples/rest-api`.

For an interactive test run:

```
docker-compose run flames bash
```

## v1

Don't use v1, it was an experiment and is  non functional
Should have be v0...
