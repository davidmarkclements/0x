# Programmatic API

### `require('0x')(opts) => Promise -> assetPath`

The `opts` argument is an object, with the following properties:

#### `argv` (array) â€“ required

Pass the arguments that the spawned Node process should receive. 

#### `workingDir` (string)

The base directory where profile folders will be placed. 

Default: process.cwd()

#### `pathToNodeBinary` (string)

The path to any node binary executable. This will be used to run execute 
the script and arguments supplied in `argv`.

Default: Node executable according to the `PATH` environment variable.

#### `name` (string) 

The name of the flamegraph HTML output file, without the extension.

Default: flamegraph

#### `onPort` (string)

Run a given command and then generate the flamegraph. 
The command as specified has access to a `$PORT` variable. 
The `$PORT` variable is set according to the first port that 
profiled process opens. 

When the load-test completes, the profiled processed will be 
sent a SIGINT and the flamegraph will be automatically generated.  

Default: ''

#### `title` (string)

Set the title to display in the flamegraph UI.

Default: argv joined by space

#### `visualizeOnly` (string)

Supply a path to a profile folder to build or rebuild visualization 
from original stacks.

Default: undefined

#### `collectOnly` (boolean)

Don't generate the flamegraph, only create the Profile Folder,
with relevant outputs.

Default: false

#### `collectDelay` (number)

Specify a delay(ms) before collecting data.

Default: 0

#### `mapFrames` (function)

A custom mapping function that receives 
an array of frames and an instance of the Profiler (see [stacks-to-json-stack-tree](http://github.com/davidmarkclements/stacks-to-json-stack-tree)).

Takes the form `(frames, profiler) => Array|false`. 

The `frames` parameter is an array of objects containing a `name` property.

Return `false` to remove the whole stack from the output, or return a 
modified array to change the output.

#### `onProcessExit` (function)

Called with the exit code when the observed process exits.

Default: ()=>{} (noop)

#### `status` (function)

Is called with status messages from 0x internals - useful for logging
or displaying status in the console. 

Default: ()=>{} (noop)

### `kernelTracing`

Use an OS kernel tracing tool (perf on Linux or DTrace on macOS and SmartOS). 
This will capture native stack frames (C++ modules and Libuv I/O), 
but may result in missing stacks on Node 8.

See [kernel-tracing.md](kernel-tracing.md) for more information.

Default: false 

#### `outputDir` (string)

Specify artifact output directory. This can be specified in template
form with possible variables being `{pid}`, `{timestamp}`, `{name}` 
(based on the `name` option) and `{outputDir}`(variables
must be specified without whitespace, e.g. `{ pid }` is not supported).

Default: `{pid}.0x`

#### `outputHtml` (string)

Specify destination of the generated flamegraph HTML file. 
This can be specified in template form with possible variables 
being `{pid}`, `{timestamp}`, `{name}` (based on the `name` flag) and 
`{outputDir}` (variables must be specified without whitespace, 
e.g. `{ pid }` is not supported). It can also be set to `-` to 
send the HTML output to STDOUT.

If either this or `name` is set to `-` then the HTML will go to STDOUT.

Default: `{outputDir}/{name}.html`

#### `treeDebug` (boolean)

Save the intermediate tree representation of captured trace output to a JSON
file.

Default: false

#### `kernelTracingDebug` (boolean)

Show output from DTrace or perf(1) tools.

Default: false

### `require('0x/lib/ticks-to-tree')(ticks, opts) => Object`

Build a stack tree from a list of stack samples (ticks). Useful for building
custom visualizations. After a `collectOnly` run, the `ticks` data is stored in
`{pid}.0x/ticks.json`. Read it using:

```js
const ticks = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('{pid}.0x/ticks.json', 'utf8'))
```

`opts` is an object with optional properties:

 - `inlined` - data about inlined functions. 0x stores this in the `meta.json`
   file, which you can read like:

   ```js
   const { inlined } = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('{pid}.0x/meta.json', 'utf8'))
   ```

 - `mapFrames(frame)` - See [mapFrames](#mapframes-function).
 - `pathToNodeBinary` - Path to the Node.js executable. Defaults to
   `process.execPath`, but it's best to set this to the executable used to
   generate the ticks data, in case of version differences and the like.

This function returns an object with properties:
 - `merged` - a tree of stack frames, where each node includes both the
   optimized and unoptimized calls for that frame.
 - `unmerged` - a tree of stack frames, where each node refers to either the
   optimized or unoptimized calls.

Each node is an object with at least the following properties:
 - `name` - The function name.
 - `value` - The number of `ticks` samples this frame appeared in.
 - `top` - The number of `ticks` samples where this frame appeared at the top
   of the stack. (higher count = hotter function)
 - `children` - An array of child node objects.
